The index.html is the html file that loads the website. It originally has a simple look, so it must be changed to the .html inside the "Change the ..." folder.

The _headers file is a necessary file that contains certain Headers(Brotli), for the program to work on certain server hosts like Netlify. If it's missing, it also exists in the "Change the ..." folder. It must exist in the root folder, i.e. the one this README exists in, next to the index.html file.

TemplateData contains some items that are loaded by the html. It also contains the splash screen and UOC logo. They can be changed(check with index.html to see details about how they're read).

The Build folder contains the built data from Unity. No DELETING!!!
